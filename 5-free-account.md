Google Cloud offers both a **Free Trial** and a **Free Tier**, but they serve different purposes:

### 1. **GCP Free Trial ($300 Credit)**
- **What it is**: A one-time promotional credit of **$300**, valid for **90 days**.
- **Purpose**: Allows new users to explore and try paid Google Cloud services.
- **Billing Requirement**: Requires a credit card (for identity verification, not charges).
- **Usage**: You can use any GCP service, including high-end ones like Compute Engine, BigQuery, and Cloud SQL, until the $300 credit runs out.
- **Upgrade to Paid**: After 90 days or once the $300 is exhausted, you must upgrade to a paid account to continue using non-free services.
- **Restriction**: Some resources have limits (e.g., only limited GPU usage), and after the trial, you lose access to paid resources unless upgraded.

### 2. **GCP Free Tier (Always Free)**
- **What it is**: A set of GCP services that remain free **indefinitely**, even after the trial expires.
- **Purpose**: Helps users run small workloads without cost.
- **No Expiration**: Unlike the Free Trial, the Free Tier is permanent.
- **Limits**: Each free service has usage caps, such as:
  - **Compute Engine**: 1 e2-micro VM instance per month (only in select regions).
  - **Cloud Storage**: 5GB of Standard Storage (US region).
  - **BigQuery**: 1TB of query processing per month.
  - **Cloud Functions**: 2 million invocations per month.
  - **Cloud Run**: 2 million requests per month.

### **Key Differences**
| Feature            | Free Trial ($300 Credit) | Free Tier (Always Free) |
|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Duration**      | 90 days | Permanent |
| **Cost**         | $300 free credit | Free within limits |
| **Service Access** | All GCP services | Selected services |
| **Usage Limits** | Until $300 is used | Strict per-month limits |
| **Requires Credit Card?** | Yes | Yes (for initial verification) |

### **Which One Should You Use?**
- If you want to test **any GCP service freely** (including premium ones), use the **Free Trial**.
- If you want to run **small workloads continuously for free**, rely on the **Free Tier**.
